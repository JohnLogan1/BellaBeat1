# Install Tidyverse
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


# Load the Data
```{r}
dailyActivity_merged <- read_csv("BellaBeat Files/dailyActivity_merged.csv")

sleepDay <- read_csv("BellaBeat Files/sleepDay_merged.csv")

weightLogInfo_merged <- read_csv("BellaBeat Files/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")

```


# Combine the Data
```{r}
combined_dActivity_sleepDay <- merge(sleepDay, dailyActivity_merged, by="Id")

combined_dActivity_sleepDay_weightLog <- merge(combined_dActivity_sleepDay, weightLogInfo_merged, by= "Id")

```


#### I Manipulated the 'dailyActivity_merged' Dataset on Excel, in Order to Add the Days of the Week (1=Sunday, 7=Saturday) and Averages for Certain Values, to Determine if there were patterns on different days of the week. This Table is called 'Weekday_Table'
```{r}
Weekday_Table <- read_csv("BellaBeat Files/bquxjob_323ecc13_17cbdfa0086.csv")

summary(Weekday_Table)
```

# Interesting Finds:

## Weekday (1=Sunday, 7=Saturday), and AverageTotalSteps:
```{r}
ggplot(data = Weekday_Table) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = WeekDay, y = Avg_Total_Steps)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = WeekDay, y = Avg_Total_Steps))

```


## Average Total Steps and Average Calories
```{r}
ggplot(data = Weekday_Table) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Avg_Total_Steps, y = Avg_Calories)) 

```


### The correlation between Average Total Steps and Average Calories is positive:
```{r}
Weekday_Table %>% 
  summarise(cor(Avg_Calories, Avg_Total_Steps))
```


## Correlation between Calories and VeryActiveMinutes is positive:
```{r}
dailyActivity_merged %>% 
  summarise(cor(Calories, VeryActiveMinutes))
```


## I created a table in Excel based off of the hourlyCalories_merged data to find the average calories burned per hour
```{r}
Avg_Cal_Per_Hour <- read_csv("BellaBeat Files/Avg_Cal_Per_Hour.csv")

Avg_Cal_Per_Hour %>% 
  summarise(min(Avg_Calories), median(Avg_Calories), max(Avg_Calories))
```


## Plot of Avg_Cal_Per_Hour:
```{r}
ggplot(data = Avg_Cal_Per_Hour) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Activity_Hour, y = Avg_Calories)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Activity_Hour, y = Avg_Calories))

```
