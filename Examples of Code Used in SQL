Here are some examples of queries that I ran in SQL to create tables/identify trends in data. I would save the tables as a CSV and upload to either Excel or R to 
analyze.

#Taken from a table which I edited in Excel:
SELECT
    DISTINCT(WeekDay),
    SUM(Calories) as Total_Calories,
    SUM(TotalSteps) as Total_Steps,
    SUM(SedentaryMinutes) as Total_Sedentary_Minutes
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.BellaBeat.Edited_Daily_Activity_Merged`
GROUP BY WeekDay
ORDER BY WeekDay


SELECT
    DISTINCT(WeekDay),
    AVG(Calories) as Avg_Calories,
    AVG(TotalSteps) as Avg_Total_Steps,
    AVG(SedentaryMinutes) as Avg_Sedentary_Minutes
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.BellaBeat.Edited_Daily_Activity_Merged`
GROUP BY WeekDay
ORDER BY WeekDay


## Finding the average calories for each hour of the day; I would change the hour in the WHERE statement and copy the result to a Spreadsheet, which I 
## repeated for each hour of the day(I couldn't think of a quicker way to query each hour into a single table)
SELECT
        AVG(Calories) as Avg_Calories
FROM `course-3-week-3-327122.BellaBeat.hourlyCalories_merged_edited`
WHERE Activity_Hour = '23:00'
