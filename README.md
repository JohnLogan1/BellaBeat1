# BellaBeat1
This is my first project, where I cleaned and analyzed data from a hypothetical case study. Essentially, BellaBeat is a health-focused tech company who specializes in smart technology to track activity. My task was to identify trends within smart device usage and come up with marketing recommendations.

I am completely new to data analysis/coding, so this also serves as a way to document my progress, and showcase some of the skills that I've learned through Google's Data Analytics certification program.

I have learned a lot from this project. Here are some of my personal takeaways:
  1. The importance of having data organized into folders. I recognized this early and made folders on my desktop to separate the original files from the edited    
     ones.
  3. The importance of documenting work. I wish I made a notes in my SQL queries to describe what my thought process was. This is something I will make an effort to      get better at in my next project.
  4. The internet is a very helpful resource. I could not have completed this project without the help of Google and StackOverflow. I've also recognized the    importance of knowing what to search for (being specific).
  5. It is possible to load and manipulate CSV files in Excel.
  6. SQL is very helpful when it comes to creating tables, and is much faster than Excel.
  7. I enjoy coding, and find it rewarding when I fix an error in my code or discover something interesting in the data.
  8. I have a lot to learn.
